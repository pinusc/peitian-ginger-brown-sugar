<ol>
<li> Burning the camellia oil to a specific temperature; </li>
<li> Mixing ginger powder, rice wine and brown sugar together according to a ratio specified by the traditional recipe; </li>
<li> Cooking it with medium fire for about 2 hours. </li>

              <p>Peitian, an ancient Hakka village, lies nested between the mountains of Liancheng County, Fujian province. Isolated both from the nearby Longyan, Peitian preserved its vibrant culture intact from outside influence. The village’s 800 years of history remained embedded into the unique Hakka architecture. The small town boasts 30 beautiful houses, 21 ancestral temples, 6 studies and one 1000-meter-long ancient street. Connecting all these sites are old cobblestone streets and water canals which, much like everything else in the village, continue to reflect the mystic beauty of forgone times. Peitian is a hidden jewel of Chinese history and culture, offering an escape the problems of the world into the joys of simpler times.

          <p>Once a safe refuge for those who fled from war zones in the far north of China, Peitian's 800 year history of being a safe heaven has been forgotten by many, and left unknown from the rest of the world. Thus, it is the current NGO's goal to stimulate economic growth and prosperity of the village, as well as putting it back on the map, by promoting one of their high quality, home made products - organic ginger brown sugar. Not only it gives a taste of Peitian's rich culture, but also a healthy addition to every local family's diet. UWC students from all over the world have come and joined the NGO by making it their common goal of introducing the ginger brown sugar to the world by promoting the village's everlasting, yet hidden, authentic beauty.

                <p class=mt-5>The Hakka ginger sugar represents more than a food ingredient, but a cultural symbol in the village of Peitian, an 800-year old village located in Longyan, Fujian. The sugar and the unique technique of making it have been presented in the life of this modest village for at least 500 years. The sugar is made from 4 purely natural ingredients: Peitian ginger, Hakka rice wine, brown sugar and camellia oil. According to Chinese medicine theory, this combination is especially beneficial for people’s physical health in an area of humid climate like Fujian.</p>

<p>Due to its rich historical legacy, the technique through which the sugar is made has gone through countless refinements. The ginger alone has to go through 6 procedures to be turned into powder before it can be used to make the sugar, a process through which only 7% of the weight is reserved. The cooking itself would take more than 3 hours.</p>

<p>Nowadays, some of the people from the village are trying to share this part of their culture to the world beyond the surrounding mountains. The local ginger sugar factory has successfully bridged tradition with modernity. While preserving the original process and techniques, the factory uses industrialized equipments to improve efficiency and overall hygiene conditions. However, according to the owner of the factory, Yuyuan Wu, who has inherited the techniques from his family, the essence of sugar is still the same as hundreds of years ago. He dismissed the notion of complete industrialization, and insists that the making process is still operated manually, though this means one batch of sugar would take more than 10 hours of intensive labor. “You cannot just leave everything to the machine because the quality is not the same, and this is how we are different from all the other ginger sugar suppliers in China.</p>
